# RNAtor
The RNAtor allows the user to optimise an RNA Seq experiment design, based on user defined parameters like the no of replicates available, fold-change at which the user is expected to detect differentially expressed genes and the size of the transcriptome used. Based on simulation experiments RNAtor calculates the depth required for sequencing of the particular transcriptome. RNAtor also provides the no of samles that can be loaded per lane for some of the sequencers. This allows the user to plan an RNA-Sequencing experiment based on the budget while also recovering the optimum result.
RNAtor was developed based on simulation RNA Sequencing experiments performed at different coverages, replicates and fold-change to depict the optimum coverage, required at a particular combination of fold-change and replicate, to detect maximum no of differentially expressed genes.
